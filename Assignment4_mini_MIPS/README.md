Implement miniMIPS processor on Logisim Simulator w/ single cycle MIPS architecture. Our task was to implement the program counter and program memory.
There were 3 parts to this assignment:
  1. build a circuit that implements an 8-bit Program Counter with reset and incrementer
  2. Implement a circuit which allows data to be read and written from program RAM
  3. Connect the out put of the Program Counter registers to the input of the RAM
